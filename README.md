## HotReads

#### Second application to our URLock Box Application, this application fulfills the following requirements:

1. When a link in [URLockbox](https://github.com/rsbarbo/URLockbox) is "read", the link's info is automatically sent to Hot Reads Application.

2. Hot Reads will create a record of the "read" links.

3. As an unauthenticated user, I can visit the Hot Reads main index page and see a list of the top-10 most-read URLs across all users (ActiveRecord sorted out). Only reads from the last 24 hours should count towards the ranking.
